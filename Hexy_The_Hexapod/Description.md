The base of the hexapod was created by the team at Arcbotics and was used in a course at Halmstad University. I was tasked with bringing the hexapod back to life and making it walk and navigate autonomously. 
Videos documenting the whole process can be found in the DEISGR2 repository, while some images showcasing the different stages can be found here.
